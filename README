Required libraries:

- World Wind Java
  WWJ is included with the distribution in the jars/worldwind
  directory. It has been tested and is functioning on Mac (all
  architectures), Windows 7 (all architectures), and Linux (32-bit
  only). 64-bit Linux is not supported. Horizon Server automatically
  detects when it is being run on Linux 86-64 and doesn't show the
  World Wind Component.

- Java3D Java3D is not included in the distribution. It can be
  downloaded at http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d
  Horizon Server will not start unless the java3d core, java3d utils
  and vecmath jarfiles are in the classpath. It also expects
  libj3dcore-ogl to be present in /lib. If your libj3dcore is in a
  different directory, you can change this in the run script by adding
  your directory to the java.library.path in the run-phase.

  To install Java3D for Ubuntu:
    - Install libjava3d-java using your favorite package manager
    - Create the symbolic links for the library:
        # ln -s /usr/lib/jni/libj3dcore-ogl.so /lib/
    - Add the following three jarfiles to your classpath:
        - /usr/share/java/j3dcore.jar
        - /usr/share/java/j3dutils.jar
        - /usr/share/java/vecmath.jar
      This can be done using the following command:
        $ echo CLASSPATH\=\$CLASSPATH:/usr/share/java/j3dcore.jar:/usr/share/java/j3dutils.jar:/usr/share/java/vecmath.jar >> ~/.zshrc
      Make sure to replace ~/.zshrc with the profile for whatever shell 
      you use. You will need to restart your terminal after running 
      this command.
