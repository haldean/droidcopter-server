Required libraries:

- World Wind Java
  WWJ is included with the distribution in the jars/worldwind
  directory. It has been tested and is functioning on Mac (all
  architectures), Windows 7 (all architectures), and Linux (32-bit
  only). 64-bit Linux is not supported. Horizon Server automatically
  detects when it is being run on Linux 86-64 and doesn't show the
  World Wind Component.

- Java3D Java3D is not included in the distribution. It can be
  downloaded at http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d
  Horizon Server will not start unless the java3d core, java3d utils
  and vecmath jarfiles are in the classpath. It also expects
  libj3dcore-ogl to be present in /lib. If your libj3dcore is in a
  different directory, you can change this in the run script by adding
  your directory to the java.library.path in the run-phase.
