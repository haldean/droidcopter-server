/**
 * <p/>
 * Provides the elevations a {@link Globe} or other object holding elevations.
 * <p/>
 * An <code>ElevationModel</code> often approximates elevations at multiple levels of spatial resolution. For any given
 * viewing position the model determines an appropriate target resolution. That target resolution may not be immediately
 * achievable, however, because the corresponding elevation data might not be locally available and must be retrieved
 * from a remote location. When this is the case, the <code>Elevations</code> object returned for a sector holds the
 * resolution achievable with the data currently available. That resolution may not be the same as the target
 * resolution. The achieved resolution is made available in the interface.
